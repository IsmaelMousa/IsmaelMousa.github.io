## Who Am I?

I am Ismael R. Mousa, born under the vibrant skies of Palestine on July 19, 2003. A seeker of knowledge and a quiet admirer of the untold mysteries of technology, I have found my calling in the ever evolving worlds of Artificial Intelligence and Data Science.


In the quiet hours of my day, I immerse myself in Machine Learning, each new concept is like unlocking a new door, revealing layers of complexity and wonder. My fascination is endless, and I remain ever open to learning, knowing the journey is far from over.


My academic story begins humbly at an industrial high school, where I specialized in Electricity. Graduating with honors was a moment of pride, but more than that, it was the spark that ignited a lifelong passion for innovation and discovery. That spark led me to further my studies in Computer Science, with a focus on AI, at [An-Najah National University](https://www.najah.edu/en/#).


I strive to stay on the cutting edge, always seeking new ways to contribute to the transformative world of AI. Yet, I approach each day with the quiet understanding that there is always more to learn, more to discover , a humble step in a vast, ever-changing landscape.


I find solace in the harmony between body and mind. The study of sports science and its connection to mental well-being fascinates me, offering me a broader lens through which to understand life. I also have a deep affection for languages and cultures, especially the rich, melodic allure of Italian 🇮🇹, a language that speaks to the heart as much as the mind.


I love movies, I hate eggplant.
